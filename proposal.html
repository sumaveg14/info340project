    <h2>Problem &amp; Data Domain</h2>
    <p>
      Minecraft is a sandbox video game where players explore, build, and survive in generated worlds made up of many different biomes. Each biome has unique environmental characteristics, structures, mobs and resources that directly affect gameplay. As the game has continued to grow over time, the number of biomes and materials has grown significantly, making it much more difficult for players to keep track of where specific resources can be found or what each biome contains. In order to fully enjoy the capabilities of the game, its important to educate the enthusiasts!
    </p>
    <p>
      The primary information problem in this space is information overload. Existing resources such as the
      <a href="https://minecraft.wiki/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Minecraft Wiki</a>
      and community made fandom pages give many details, but they are often text-heavy, and difficult to go through while actively playing the game. Players frequently need quick, information like which biomes contain certain materials or structures, but current tools are not designed for fast filtering, personalization, or interactive exploration. Video tutorials and guides on platforms like
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a>
      can also be helpful, but they are time-consuming and not easily searchable for specific needs. Because of this, both new and experienced players struggle to efficiently access biome-related information in a way that supports real-time decision-making during gameplay.

    <h2>App Description</h2>
    <p>
      The primary users of this website are Minecraft players of any skill levels. This includes anyone from beginners who want to learn about the game's diverse biomes to experienced players who want a quick reference while playing. This will most likely include a significant population of younger users (ages 8-18) who make up a large portion of Minecraft's users, as well as adult players and gamers. Given Minecraft's global reach, users will come from diverse many different backgrounds. To ensure accessibility for users with visual impairments or color blindness, the app will include alt text for images, sufficient color contrast. The app will also use clear and simple language to be accessible to younger users and non-native English speakers from across the globe.

    <p>
      The app will include three significant interactive features: 1. Biome Filtering and Search: Users can filter biomes by properties such as climate (cold, temperate, hot), dimension (Overworld, Nether, End), or resources. This allows players to quickly find biomes that contain specific materials they need. 2. Interactive Material Tracker: Users can mark materials as "collected" or "needed," creating a personalized tracking system during their session. This can make it more interactive and helps players set goals. 3. Favorites: Users can favorite specific biomes or materials for quick reference, which they can then view in their favorites list.
    </p>

    <p>
      Users will have access to comprehensive information about Minecraft's many biomes, including biome names and descriptions, climate characteristics, available blocks and materials, structures generated in each biome, and images. The data will be sourced from the Minecraft Wiki and put into a JSON file for this project.
    </p>

    <p>
      This app addresses the information overload Minecraft players face. The game has over 60 biomes across three dimensions, each with unique resources and structures. Wikis do exist, but they're very densely filled with text and hard to navigate quickly while actively playing. They're also not conducive to exploration, but are rather a place to search for information. This Pokédex style interface provides a visual and interactive way to explore and track biome information, making it easier for players to explore resources and plan more efficiently. It will also lower the barrier to entry for new players while still providing a new resource for experienced players.
