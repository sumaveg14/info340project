  <h2>Problem &amp; Data Domain</h2>

  <p>
    Minecraft is a sandbox video game where players explore, build, and survive
    in generated worlds made up of many different biomes. Each
    biome has unique environmental characteristics, structures, mobs and resources
    that directly affect gameplay. As the game has continued to
    grow over time, the number of biomes and materials has grown significantly,
    making it much more difficult for players to keep track of where specific
    resources can be found or what each biome contains. In order to fully enjoy the capabilities of the game,
    its important to educate the enthusiasts!

  <p>
    The primary information problem in this space is information overload.
    Existing resources such as the
    <a href="https://minecraft.wiki/" target="_blank">Minecraft Wiki</a> and
    community made fandom pages give many details, but they are
    often text-heavy, and difficult to go through while actively playing the
    game. Players frequently need quick, information like which
    biomes contain certain materials or structures, but current tools are not
    designed for fast filtering, personalization, or interactive exploration.
    Video tutorials and guides on platforms like
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank">YouTube</a> can also be
    helpful, but they are time-consuming and not easily searchable for specific
    needs. Because of this, both new and experienced players struggle to efficiently
    access biome-related information in a way that supports real-time
    decision-making during gameplay.
