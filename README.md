### Minecraft Interactive Website App Description: 


The primary users of this website are Minecraft players of any skill levels. This includes anyone from beginners who want to learn about the game’s diverse biomes to experienced players who want a quick reference while playing. This will most likely include a significant population of younger users (ages 8-18) who make up a large portion of Minecraft’s users, as well as adult players and gamers. Given Minecraft’s global reach, users will come from diverse many different backgrounds. To ensure accessibility for users with visual impairments or color blindness, the app will include alt text for images, sufficient color contrast. The app will also use clear and simple language to be accessible to younger users and non-native English speakers from across the globe.

The app will include three significant interactive features:
	1.	Biome Filtering and Search: Users can filter biomes by properties such as climate (cold, temperate, hot), dimension (Overworld, Nether, End), or resources. This allows players to quickly find biomes that contain specific materials they need.
	2.	Interactive Material Tracker: Users can mark materials as “collected” or “needed,” creating a personalized tracking system during their session. This can make it more interactive and helps players set goals.
	3.	Favorites: Users can favorite specific biomes or materials for quick reference, which they can then view in their favorites list.

Users will have access to comprehensive information about Minecraft’s many biomes, including biome names and descriptions, climate characteristics, available blocks and materials, structures generated in each biome, and images. The data will be sourced from the Minecraft Wiki and put into a JSON file for this project.


This app addresses the information overload Minecraft players face. The game has over 60 biomes across three dimensions, each with unique resources and structures. Wikis do exist, but they’re very densely filled with text and hard to navigate quickly while actively playing. They’re also not conducive to exploration, but are rather a place to search for information. This Pokédex style interface provides a visual and interactive way to explore and track biome information, making it easier for players to explore resources and plan more efficiently. It will also lower the barrier to entry for new players while still providing a new resource for experienced players.

In this proposal, there is a sample CSS and HTML document where the HTML document has a very basic web page that is supposed to show the skeleton on what the actual web page looks like. The CSS file is extremely basic and has two sections, one for the body and one for the section.
